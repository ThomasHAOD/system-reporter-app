## Setup Tribulations

In trying to set up React with webpack/babel for the first time I struggled to get hot reloading working in the browser. No matter how many tutorials I looked over, I could not work out why it wouldn't hot reload. It's likely I had different things wrong at different times, which is potentially a lesson in why you should read the documentation carefully/try combinations of things one by one? Who knows, I'm just happy it's working now so I'll commit this initial set up and begin the day by day account below.
